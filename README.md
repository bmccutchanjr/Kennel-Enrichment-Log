# Kennel-Enrichment-Log

Kennel Enrichment Log is a personal excersize for me inspired by my time at the Humane Society of Summit County.  It is a web based analog to the real world paper based method volunteers at the shelter use to log activity with the animals, primarily the dogs.  There are two forms that need to be filled out.

First and most important is a sign-out sheet.  Volunteers are required to sign an animal out before taking it out of its cage, and sign them back in after returning it to its cage.  This helps the staff find an animal if they need to and to ensure that all of the animals are getting some socialization experience.

There is another form, a table listing each animal with a space to indicate some volunteer has spent time with that animal on a given day.  Who that volunteer is, or how long they spent with an animal doesn't matter for this form, it's just a true/false.  Someone got this animal out for some amount of time on this date.  The purpose is to help volunteers make an informed decision on which animals are most in need of quality time.

Problem is not everyone uses these forms every time.  And some volunteers don't use either form.  They also get quite messy and sometimes difficult to interpret as animals are added to or removed from the list.

This application is not in use at the shelter.  It's a personal excersize for me.

This is a close approximation for the second form mentioned above, but gives the volunteers more information and more options to look at the data.  Foremost, the page allows volunteers to sort the data in many different ways.
